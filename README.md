# VAMP_project

This project was written specifically to run on a **Tinker V** board (RISC-V architecture).

## Requirements

- A Tinker V board (or any RISC-V architecture)
- An Arduino (for receive GPIO signals)
- A Linuxhost machine for cross-compling
- [`riscv-gnu-toolchain`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) for compling VAMP code
